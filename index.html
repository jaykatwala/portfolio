									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p>Greetings!üñê I'm a hands-on Mechanical Engineer with diverse experience, particularly in the rigour of quality assurance and the precision of CNC machine operationüîß. My previous endeavours include immersive stints at the Schaeffler Group and Shree Umiya Enterprise in the vibrant state of Gujarat.

										I am dedicated and driven, with a keen focus on quality and precision in manufacturing. I believe that every product we work with carries our signature - an embodiment of our commitment to excellenceüéØ.
										
										Complementing my engineering background, my experience as a CNC machine operator has allowed me to navigate the intricate world of efficient and effective manufacturing, visibly impacting product performance and reliability.
										
										I am eager to tackle new challenges, continue growing, and contribute further to the engineering domain. If you are on the lookout for an engineer who can meticulously improve processes whilst mitigating risks, or merely wish to discuss the fascinating world of mechanics, do feel free to connect. I am always open to forging new professional relationships and collaborative avenuesüöÄ</p>

									During my internship at Suhnai Industries, I engaged in wood working using CNC machines and actively participated in the production of various MDF sheets. This hands-on experience equipped me with valuable insights into precision machining and the woodworking industry. Additionally, I played a role in the design process using ArtCAM, contributing to the creation and refinement of sheet designs. This dual experience allowed me to integrate both creative and technical skills, gaining proficiency in design with ArtCAM and the practical application of CNC machinery in manufacturing.During my internship at Suhnai Industries, I engaged in wood working using CNC machines and actively participated in the production of various MDF sheets.
